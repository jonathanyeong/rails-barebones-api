# Barebones Rails API template

A barebones Rails API template ready for you to build your fancy APIs.

After cloning the template, start the server by running:

```bash
# install gems
bundle install
# start server
rails server
```

## Devcontainers

The template includes [Rails devcontainers](https://github.com/rails/devcontainer) so you don't need to have Rails or Ruby installed!

To use devcontainers inside VSCode, install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

## Deploying your application

This template also includes [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/). Adjust the `config/deploy.yml` file to fit your deployment needs.
